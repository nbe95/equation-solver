# Equation Solver

Back in 2015, this basic math problem was one of my very first coding exercises
I did on my own.

Yes, it's far from perfect and it's written in HTML and JavaScript. But, with a
little bit of patience, [it gets the job
done](https://nbe95.github.io/equation-solver/)! :smiling_face_with_tear:

## Objective

> Assign the numbers from 1 to 7 to the variables m...k so that this equation
> evaluates to true:
>
> **m * a = t+h < e > m < a+t = i > k**
